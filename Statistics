Histogram:
It consits of count of a featutre withiin the bin of values.
like in the bin of 10 - 20 total number of points are 20 then for that particular feature ,
the building will be plotted where X axis = bin value, Y axis  = count.
using the graph the bell curve can be formed which helps in identifying the Normal Distribution.
Bell Curve is called as probability density function.

Z- Score:
Helps in getting exact probability of points in particular region by converting the guassian Curve into Standard normal Distribution.
